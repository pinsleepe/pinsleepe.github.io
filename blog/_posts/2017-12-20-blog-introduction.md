*So what is the opposite of Serendip, a southern land of spice and
warmth, lush greenery and hummingbirds, seawashed, sunbasted? Think of
another world in the far north, barren, icebound, cold, a world of
flint and stone. Call it Zembla. Ergo: zemblanity, the opposite of
serendipity, the faculty of making unhappy, unlucky and expected
discoveries by design.* – Armadillo, by William Boyd, 1998.

Yes, the modern landscape of data science is all sugar and spice,
Serendip, if you believe all those blog posts and overal internet
hype. The allure of the seredipitous discovery is irresistible to too
many.  But what does it actually means? Can we call a Netflix
recommendation for "Friends" a seredipitous discovery when you were
looking instead for something more like "Stranger Things"?

Seredipitous discovery requires segacity, a wisdom of recognising the
unexpected and following it. People are not always capable of drawing
that connection.  Anyway, how many unexpected things can one find in a
customer database? We will always be looking for the relationships
between different variables. They might be unexpected, yes, but were
not found by accident.  It's inference from data, not serendipity.
There is a word for it - *semantic bleaching*.

Zemblanity in contrast, is an unavoidable discovery of what we don't
want to know. For example finding out that your grandma has died. I
know, how morbid... The manifestation of zemblanity in our new data
driven reality  is much more sinister. Let me give here a little
background. For the past few centuries the dominant form of economic
system was and is capitalism. The way the wealth is accumulated
defines the type of capitalism. Thus we had the mass-production
corporate capitalism that later morphed into financial capitalism. The
Economist announced in the middle of 2017 that *the world’s most
valuable resource is no longer oil, but data*. Surely, capitalism is
taking us on another ride, and it is there we find zemblanity.

This new form of capitalism, by some called *surveillance capitalism*,
is a place where world is reborn as data. Don't get me wrong, no
technology is inherently evil, but this is socially and legally
undefended territory. If unchallenged, surveillance capitalism is a
threat to democracy. It thrives on public ignorance and we as data
scientist have a big part to play in this system. To learn more about
surveillance capitalism and the *Big Other*, I encourage you to read
[this paper] by Shoshana Zuboff.

So, which one will it be?
