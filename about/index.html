	<h1>About</h1><hr>
	<p>I live in South Africa and since September 2016 I'm the
	Research Data Scientist at the SKA SA - an international
	project to build the worldâ€™s largest and most sensitive radio
	telescope.</p>
	<p>Before SKA SA, I spent 3.5 years working on my PhD in Radio
	Astronomy at Manchester University, UK. You can find my thesis
	<a
	href="https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/uk-ac-man-scw:262829?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_treasury%3BA%2BEYqFPrSTy7yLc1Nx%2BtHA%3D%3D">here</a>
	and a shorter version of the most important bit <a
	href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06825">on arXiv</a>. And
	before that I was involved in three projects at Rutherford
	Appleton Laboratory, where I learned LabView, tested
	components for ALMA telescope and designed a low noise
	amplifier.</p>
	<p>When I write code I usually do it in Python, and
	occasionally in Matlab. Most of what I've been doing at SKA is
	dockerisation and pipeline development. I've started this blog
	to document my explorations of open data and my journey to be
	better at data engineering. Hopefully you will find it useful.</p>

	<p>Outside of technology, I live in Cape Town with my husband
	and a cat. I spend too much money on my Mercedes Benz W124
	from 1988 and I collect and restore mid-century modern
	furnitures. I'm a Pole and this should tell you everything
	about my cheerful and sunny disposition. When I was a teenager
	I spent my nights hunting for aliens and counting meteorites.
	In the future I want to be a futurologist.</p>
