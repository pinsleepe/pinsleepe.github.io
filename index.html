     		<h1>Zemblanity in Data Science</h1><hr>
		<p><em>So what is the opposite of Serendip, a southern
		land of spice and warmth, lush greenery and
		hummingbirds, seawashed, sunbasted? Think of another
		world in the far north, barren, icebound, cold, a
		world of flint and stone. Call it Zembla. Ergo:
		zemblanity, the opposite of serendipity, the faculty
		of making unhappy, unlucky and expected discoveries by
		design.</em> â€“ Armadillo, by William Boyd, 1998.</p>

		<p>Yes, the modern landscape of data science is all
		sugar and spice, Serendip, if you believe all those blog
		posts and overal internet hype. The allure of the
		seredipitous discovery is irresistible to too many.
		But what does it actually means? Can we call a Netflix
		recommendation for "Friends" a seredipitous discovery when you
		were looking instead for something more like "Stranger
		Things"? Many people do, thus its meaning becomes
		eroded.</p>
		<p>Seredipitous discovery requires segacity, a wisdom
		of recognising the unexpected and following it. People
		are not always capable of drawing that connection.
		Anyway, how many unexpected things can one find in a
		customer database? We will always be looking for the
		relationships between different variables. They might
		be unexpected, yes, but were not found by accident.
		It's inference from data, not serendipity.</p> 
		<p>Zemblanity in contrast, is an unavoidable discovery
		of what we don't want to know. For example finding out
		that your grandma has died. I know, how morbid...  </p>
