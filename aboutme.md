I live in South Africa and since September 2016 I'm the Research Data
Scientist at the SKA SA - an international project to build the
worldâ€™s largest and most sensitive radio telescope.

Before SKA SA, I spent 3.5 years working on my PhD in Radio Astronomy
at Manchester University, UK. You can find my thesis [here] and a
shorter version of the most important bit on [arXiv]. And before that
I was involved in three projects at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory,
where I learned LabView, tested components for ALMA telescope and
designed a low noise amplifier.

When I write code I usually do it in Python, and occasionally in
Matlab. Most of what I've been doing at SKA is dockerisation and
pipeline development. I've started this blog to document my
explorations of open data and my journey into the rabbit hole after
the *Big Other*.

Outside of technology, I live in Cape Town with my husband and a cat.
I spend too much money on my Mercedes Benz W124 from 1988 and I
collect and restore mid-century modern furnitures. I'm a Pole and
this should tell you everything about my cheerful and sunny
disposition. 

As a teenager I spent my nights hunting for aliens, but ended up
counting meteores most of the time. In the future I want to be a
futurologist.
