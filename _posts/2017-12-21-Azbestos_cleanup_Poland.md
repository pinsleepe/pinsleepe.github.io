Ever since I read <a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/">Think Stats</a> by Allen B. Downey, I'm a frequent guest on all websites ending with .gov.pl, hoping to find inspiration and interesting data. I'm still amased how much data one can find on goverment websites. During my most recent perusing of danepubliczne.gov.pl, the mention of azbestos cought my eye.

First, what is asbestos? Asbestos is a mineral that can be pulled into fine fibres with high resistance to heat, electricity and chemical corrosion. In the past it was a common ingredient in construction materials (caveat: this is at least true for the European Union). Why in the past? Asbestos is a threat to the health due to its fibre structure. Microscopic fibers can become trapped in the respiratory system, causing cancer and other disease decades after exposure.

My home country, Poland, joined the European Union in 2004 and in 2009
the official asbesots clean up began with a goal to finish by 2032. In
this blog post I will analyse how this cleanup is progressing and try
to connect few other datasets to find correlations.
